# How to run the test

First, reference the [README](../README.md#how-to-run-the-api) and ensure the API is up and running (you may need to change the port based on where you are running this).

Then run the following commands.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install requests
python interactive_test.py
```

An interactive terminal like this should then appear

```
Interactive Shopify Agent Test. Type 'quit' to exit.
