see their contact information on the screen. My current objective as defined by the state of the state machine is to determine which flow the user should enter into next. Is the user's question related to
the current objective? true. Has the objective of the current state been met? true. The tool outputs are missing information about which flow the user wants to enter into. Based on the tool outputs, I 
will give the customer a factually grounded response which says they've provided all necessary information."
