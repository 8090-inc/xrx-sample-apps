# Reasoning

This directory contains the reasoning applications for the xRx repository.

The reasoning systems process input, generate responses and manage the overall conversation flow within the xRx framework. Each subdirectory in this folder represents a different application, including a specific reasoning agent and an UI.

## Available Reasoning Applications

1. [Simple Agent](./simple-app): A basic template for creating custom reasoning agents.
2. [Shopify Agent](./shopify-app): An agent designed to handle app-based interactions with a Shopify store.
3. [Wolfram Agent](./wolfram-assistant-app): An agent designed to handle math and physics-based interactions.
4. [Patient Information Agent](./patient-information-app): An agent designed to collect and manage patient information before a doctor's visit.

## Usage

To use a specific reasoning application, you need to go into the specific folder, set the `.env` variables and run the `docker compose`.

For more detailed information on how to implement and use these reasoning systems, please refer to the README files within each application's subdirectory.
